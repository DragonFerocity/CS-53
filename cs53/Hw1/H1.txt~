1. You are given a wrod to find in a dictionary. Your algorithm is to
describe how this is done.
	  I. Open the dictionary to the first page.
	 II. Look at the first word on the page and compare that word to the
word you are looking for. If the words don't match, continue to the next
step.
	III. Look at the next word on the page, moving to the next column
when necessary, or flipping the page when necessary. Compare that word to
the word you are looking for. If the words don't match, continue to the next
step.
	 IV. Repeat step III, until you find the word you are looking for.


2. Describe how to arrive at the value of A/B given that A and Ba are whole
numbers
	  I. Set C equal to 0. If B is greater than A, don't continue to
the next step; the answer is 0. If B is less than A, move on to the next
step.
	 II. Increase C by 1. Multiply B by C, and set that equal to B'. If
B' is greater than A, move to step III. If B' is less than A, repeat step
II.
	III. If B' is less than A, repeat step II. Otherwise, your answer C
decreased by 1.


3. What kind of bunny am I hunting? What are the weather conditions? 
	  I. Wake up
	 II. Look out the window to see if it is raining. If it is raining,
set Rain to true. If it is not raining set Rain to false.
	III. Look at the thermometer to see what the temperature is. Store
the temperature as Temp. 
	 IV. Now go and find your mother and ask her what kind of bunny she
wants to cook for dinner. Remember the kind of bunny as BunnyType.
	  V. Go to the garage where your guns are stored. 
	 VI. If BunnyType (the bunny your mom wants) is equal to Plastic, and
Temp is less than or equal to 0 degrees Celcius, pick up the Shotgun and go
out and try to shoot some Plastic bunnies. Otherwise move on to the next step.
	VII. If BunnyType is equal to Chocolate, and Temp is less than or
equal to 20 degrees Celcius and Rain is equal to false, pick up either the Shotgun
or the Rifle and go out and try to shoot some chocolate bunnies. If BunnyType is equal
to Chocolate, and Temp is less than or equal to 20 degrees Celcius, and Rain
is equal to true, pick up the Shotgun and go outside and try to shoot some
chocolate bunnies. Otherwise, move on to the next step.
       VIII. If BunnyType is equal to Porcelain, and Temp is greater than or
equal to 0 degrees Celcius, and Rain is equal to false, pick up the rifle,
and go out and try to shoot some porcelain bunnies. If BunnyType is equal to
Porcelain, and Temp is greater than or equal to 0 degrees Celcius, and Rain
is equal to true, Stop, you can hunt Porcelain bunnies in the rain because
rifles can't be used in the rain.
	 IX. Repeat step 1 through 9 for the rest of your days.


4. Guess the bunnies number.
	  I. Wait for the bunny to think of it's number.
	 II. Once the bunny tells you it has a number, select a number
between 0 and 9, remember this as Digit1
	III. Now select a number between 0 and
9, and multiply that number by 10, remeber this as Digit10.
	 IV. Now select a
number between 0 and 9 again, and multiply this number by 100, remember this
as Digit100.
	  V. Now add Digit1 + Digit10 + Digit100 to get your 3 digit-number,
remember this as DigitFull.
	 VI. Proceed to ask the bunny if DigitFull is the number it was
thinking of, If the bunny says No, move on to step 5. If the bunny says Yes,
stop, and shoot the bunnie.
	VII. Listen to the three digit-number that the bunny tells you. If there is a zero in the ones
place, you know that Digit1 is wrong. If there is a one in the ones place,
you know that Digit1 is correct.
       VIII. If there is a zero in the tens place, then you know that
Digit10 is wrong. If there is a one in the tens place, then you know that
Digit10 is correct.
	 IX. If there is a zero in the hundreds place, then you know that
Digit100 is wrong. If there is a one in the hundreds place, then you know
that Digit100 is correct.
          X. If Digit1 is wrong, repeat step 2, and then return to step 10.
	 XI. If Digit10 is wrong, repeat step 3, and then return to step 11.
	XII. If Digit100 is wrong, repeate step 4, and then return to step
12.
       XIII. Now repeat steps 5 through 13.
