I bent my wookie!
When I grow up, I want to be a principal or a caterpillar.
I'm too scared to even wet my pants.
This is my sandbox, I'm not allowed to go in the deep end.
Go Banana!
What's a diorama?
Wheeeee....owe, I bit my tongue.
My toys are all sticky.
So, do yxou like .... stuff?
I ated the purple berries.
I found a moon rock in my nose.
Oh boy, sleep!  That's where I'm a Viking!
I heard a Frankenstein lives there.
My parents won't let me use scissors.
